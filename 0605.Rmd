## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

utility_cobb_douglass(1,2,.beta=0.8,.alpha=0.5)
utility_cobb_douglass(1,.beta=0.8,2,0.5)
utility_cobb_douglass(1,.beta=0.8,.alpha=0.5,2)
```

```{r}
utility_cobb_douglass(y=2,x=1,0.5,0.8)


```

```{r}
for(i in gmailAddress){

for(i in c(1:4)){
  print(i)
  print(gmailAddress[[i]])
}

for(i in seq_along(gmailAddress)){
  print(i)
  print(gmailAddress[[i]])
}
