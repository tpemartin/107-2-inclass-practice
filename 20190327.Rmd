## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

library(lubridate)

```{r}
dtObject<-ymd_hms("1970-01-01 00:02:53") 
```

```{r}
class(dtObject)
```

```{r}
twDateTime <- ymd_hms("2019-03-18 14:04:00", tz="Asia/Taipei")
LisbonDateTime <- with_tz(twDateTime,tzone="Europe/Lisbon")
```
